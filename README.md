This project was created through the use of python and was made to decrease the time it takes to go through the workflow of collecting website statistics for the following sites: Libwizard, Libanswers, Libcal, Libguides, Primo(WIP), and Library.mines.edu.  This was all done through api requests through matomo-api and is formatted into excel files after pulling data in the csv format.
