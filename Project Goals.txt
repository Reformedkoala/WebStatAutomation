// Integrate successfully with the matomo api and be able to pull data automatically
    //Matomo api seems to work okay just need to figure out how to pull data from requests library
    //Pull data with proper params and authentication
// Automate the parsing and correction of the data from a csv or tsv into an Excel file
    // Possibly going to use Pandas for the filtering of the data and to get it into an easy to read format
    // Correct data coming from Page Titles, Outlinks, and Referring URLs for each website
// Create a user interface for future users to interact with and pull data when needed
    // Not sure entirely how this will work, could be a webpage, program, or something else that a user can run
    // Might have to learn a language besides C++ and python in order to make this look good or take a template
